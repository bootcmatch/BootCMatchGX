# BootCMatchGX
BootCMatch for multi-GPU systems
Sparse solvers are one of the building blocks of any technology for reliable and high-performance scientific and engineering computing. In BootCMatchGX we make available an Algebraic MultiGrid (alpha-AMG) method for preconditioning algebraic linear systems Ax = b, where A is a symmetric positive definite (s.p.d.), large and sparse matrix. All the computational kernels for setup and application of the adaptive AMG method, as preconditioner of an efficient version of the Conjugate Gradient Krylov solver, were designed and tuned for hybrid MPI-CUDA programming environments when multiple distributed nodes hosting Nvidia GPUs are available.
